# Next.js 15 App Router Silent Rendering Error

This repository demonstrates a subtle rendering error that can occur in Next.js 15's App Router.  The error isn't always caught by standard error handling, leading to a blank page or incomplete rendering.

## Problem

A simple Next.js app using the App Router might fail to render correctly without producing clear error messages in the browser's developer console.  This often manifests as a blank page or a partially rendered page.

## Solution

The solution involves adding robust error handling and logging to pinpoint the exact source of the rendering issue.  The updated `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to implement comprehensive logging using `console.error`. This will help diagnose the problem. It might also be necessary to check for issues in your data fetching or component structure.
